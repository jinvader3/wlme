# Wavelike Mapping Experiment

This is a ecosystem of tools to enable the experimentation of mapping systems that use the wavelike properties of acoustic and electromagnetic waves.

## MeshCage Scripts

The meshcage simulates waves as particle or photons. It currently does not calculate refraction or diffraction. It calculates simple reflection.

The `meshcage.py` is obsolete. It is replaced by `meshcage2.py` which features a command line interface.

## Chirp Script

This script produces a chirp to be used with meshcage.

## Try Scripts

The `try1.py` and `try2.py` are my experiments at mapping.
